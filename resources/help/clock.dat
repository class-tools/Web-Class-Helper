Modify clock list.

Usage:

CLOCK ADD [hour] [minute] [name]
CLOCK DELETE [hour] [minute] [name]
CLOCK CLEAR

"CLOCK CLEAR" has no parameters.

If [name] has Spaces, please add double quotation marks.

You can add a zero in front of [hour] / [minute] if it is less than 10. (Not required)

These two commands are same:

CLOCK ADD 1 1 "something a"

CLOCK ADD 01 01 "something a"
